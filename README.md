## 🎓 Learning Approach

Each lab follows a consistent structure:

1. **Objectives** - Clear learning goals
2. **Concepts Covered** - Key topics you'll learn
3. **Prerequisites** - What you should know beforehand
4. **Task Description** - What you need to build
5. **Validation Criteria** - How to verify your solution
6. **Verification Commands** - Commands to test your work
7. **Hints** - Guidance without giving away the solution
8. **Bonus Challenges** - Extra practice for deeper learning
9. **Resources** - Links to relevant documentation

## 💡 Tips for Success

- **Work Sequentially**: Labs build on each other's concepts
- **Read Carefully**: Each lab README contains important details
- **Validate Your Work**: Use the provided validation criteria
- **Try Before Peeking**: Attempt to solve independently before checking solutions
- **Experiment**: Don't be afraid to try different approaches
- **Document**: Take notes on what you learn
